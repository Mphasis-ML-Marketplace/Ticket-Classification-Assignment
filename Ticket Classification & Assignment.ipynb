    "## Ticket Classification Prediction\n",
    "The solution handles the misclassification of tickets using multifactor AI/ML based classification model. The As-Is classification scheme leads to higher MTTR(Mean Time to Resolution) and low FCR (First Call Resolution) due to misclassification of tickets. The current scheme handles these problems by automating classification of tickets using classification models. The solution considers factors such as ticket impact, urgency, priority along with ticket description and ticket categories.\n",
